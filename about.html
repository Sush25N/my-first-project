              <p class="lead"> 1. Be Her Listener</p>
              <p>What most men think is they have to climb the mountains or do something extraordinary to please their wives. Your wife is a human being just like you and humans have emotions. Sometimes when she has a stressful day, all she wants is someone to patiently listen to her. Be her listener, don’t judge, and let her unwind by opening up to you. Don’t try to give suggestions or fix her problems. Keep your open ears and just listen. And when she’s done, give her a big hug to make her feel better. This is also how to make your wife happy when angry or gloomy.</p>
             <p class="lead">2. Hug Her Everyday</p>
             <p>When you return home from work, make it your first priority to hug her. Maybe add in a kiss and you’ve got a winning bonus right there. Regular bodily contact is the backbone of long-lasting and fulfilling romantic relationships. Remember that.</p>
             <p class="lead">3. Compliment Her in Public Whenever You Introduce</p>
             <p>If you’re thinking of introducing your wife to your friends, co-workers, or any other social circles, make sure to do so with a compliment. It may be a small feat for you but it means a lot to your wife. A compliment in public indicates that you acknowledge her as your better half as well as the fact that you cherish your relationship with her. Do this if you’re serious about making your wife happy every day.</p>
             <p class="lead">4. Cook for Her</p>
             <p>Making a homemade meal for your wife is one of the best ways to win her heart. Always ask what she wants to eat. It’s about being her personal slave but rather paying attention to her needs. And when you cook her favourite dishes, she’ll be falling madly in love with you for respecting that.</p>
             <p class="lead">5. Compliment Her Looks</p>
             <p>Be sure to compliment her looks from time to time. This goes a long way and keeps the passion brimming. If she asks for your opinion on what she’s wearing, pay attention to the colours and designs and compliment her choices. If you don’t like it, just tell her to try another design but never ever say that the dress looks terrible on her.</p>
             <p class="lead">6. Treat Her with Kindness and Grace</p>
             <p>Never take a harsh tone or be judgemental when it comes to talking to your wife and hearing her out. Be kind, act with grace, and speak in a soft tone. This ensures that you don’t come off as a threatening person but rather someone she can trust and open up to.</p>
